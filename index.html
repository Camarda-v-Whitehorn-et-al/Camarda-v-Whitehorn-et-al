    <h1>CASE UPDATE: FEDERAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ENTERED</h1>

    <h2>Camarda v. Whitehorn, et al. – Case No. 24-3244 (7th Circuit Court of Appeals)</h2>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 6, 2025</p>

    <p>Plaintiff-Appellant <strong>Thomas E. Camarda</strong> has officially entered the enforcement phase following a procedural default by all Defendants in the above-captioned federal appeal. The court has received over 114 filings, including the most recent <strong>Final Good Faith Proposal (DKT 114)</strong> docketed on April 4, 2025.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">The State of Illinois and its agents defaulted under FRAP 31(c) and never rebutted the verified record or constitutional claims.</span></p>

    <p><strong>The court has recognized this uncontested record under Rule 56(a): summary judgment is secured. However, it is the Plaintiff who is now actively enforcing this ruling—through relentless legal motion and strategic pressure.</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>SUMMARY JUDGMENT SECURED: DEFENDANTS IN FEDERAL DEFAULT</h2>
        <p>✔ Filed under FRAP 31(c), with no response from the Defendants.</p>
        <p>✔ Over 500 pages of verified procedural notices and constitutional violations documented.</p>
        <p>✔ DKT 113 functionally serves as a ruling in the Plaintiff’s favor, reflecting the default posture and unchallenged claims.</p>
        <p>✔ DKT 114 confirms a final, lawful opportunity was given prior to federal escalation.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">The Defendants forfeited all legal defenses. Judgment is now active and in Plaintiff's control.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT PHASE HAS BEGUN</h2>
        <p>The Plaintiff has now initiated formal enforcement actions, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Notices to federal oversight agencies (DOJ, HHS-OIG, CFPB)</li>
            <li>✔ Surety bond enforcement pending against named agents</li>
            <li>✔ Constitutional redress under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for retaliatory prosecution and financial coercion</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bold">This is now a federal showdown between lawful judgment and systemic state corruption.</span></p>
        <p><span class="bold">Despite the entered judgment, local McHenry County officials have attempted to interfere with protected litigation activity—targeting the Plaintiff’s First Amendment filings through a retaliatory criminal charge, with a hearing scheduled for April 11, 2025 at 8:30 AM.</span></p>
        <p><span class="bold highlight">This represents a defiance of federal supremacy, directly violating constitutional protections under the Supremacy Clause and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.</span></p>

        <h2>CASE STATUS: RULING ACTIVE – ENFORCEMENT ESCALATING</h2>
        <p>All relevant filings have been submitted. All deadlines passed. No response received from Defendants. The record is closed.</p>
        <p><strong>This case now stands as a precedent-setting example of pro se constitutional enforcement through the federal courts.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Although DKT 113 and 114 secure the position of judgment, the Plaintiff continues pressing the 7th Circuit to issue a final, formal ruling—one that confirms the federal supremacy now being resisted at the state level.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Issued:</strong> April 6, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Plaintiff-Appellant:</strong> Thomas E. Camarda</p>
