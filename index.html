URGENT CASE UPDATE: FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

Camarda v. Whitehorn, et al. – Case No. 24-3244 (7th Circuit Court of Appeals)

Date: March 19, 2025

Plaintiff-Appellant Thomas E. Camarda provides the following critical procedural update on the ongoing federal appeal before the Seventh Circuit and the ongoing retaliatory actions by Illinois state agencies.

This case has escalated into a major constitutional crisis, with federal supremacy, due process, and civil rights violations at the forefront.

The Defendants are in total and unrecoverable default in the federal appeal, yet Illinois state officials continue unlawful actions, directly defying federal law.

This is a legal and constitutional emergency that now demands maximum judicial enforcement.

1️. FEDERAL DEFAULT: DEFENDANTS HAVE FORFEITED ALL DEFENSES

Defendants failed to respond under FRAP 31(c), placing them in TOTAL procedural default.

•	Under FRAP 31(c), when a party fails to respond in a federal appeal, they forfeit all arguments and admit liability by default.

•	This means that Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) and all named officials have no legal standing left in this case.

The Defendants have ignored federal authority for over SIX MONTHS.

They have attempted to pretend this lawsuit does not exist.

Now, they face the consequences: full-scale federal legal accountability.

Any continued state enforcement is an illegal end-run around their default, a flagrant abuse of power that must be enjoined immediately.

2. SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW & JUDICIAL CONTEMPT

The State of Illinois is in active and knowing violation of federal law.

✔ Defendants’ continued actions violate the Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2)
✔  Defendants are in violation of controlling Supreme Court precedent (Blackledge v. Perry, Ex Parte Young, McCulloch v. Maryland, and more).
✔  Unlawful state enforcement while a federal case is pending constitutes a due process violation, obstruction of justice, and financial fraud.

Key Violations Committed by the State of Illinois:

1.	Fraudulent Wage Garnishment and Asset Seizure – Title IV-D collections continue despite clear violations of federal law and procedural due process.

2.	Retaliatory Criminal Prosecution in McHenry County – The state is pursuing an illegal case in direct violation of Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974).

3.	Unlawful Amendments to Collection Orders – Defendants have issued a fraudulent, post-default amended IWO, which constitutes direct defiance of federal jurisdiction.

4.	Financial Coercion & Retaliation – Ongoing unlawful financial enforcement violates 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and exposes all involved officials to personal liability under federal law.

THESE ARE NOT MINOR PROCEDURAL ISSUES. THESE ARE MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS WITH MASSIVE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES.

3. TITLE IV-D FRAUD AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL CRIMES

Illinois is engaged in systemic Title IV-D fraud, using unlawful collection actions to sustain an illegal revenue stream under 42 U.S.C. § 658a.

The Defendants' conduct amounts to STATE-SPONSORED FINANCIAL FRAUD.

Key Facts:
✔ Illinois receives federal incentives for every dollar collected under Title IV-D.
✔ The state is unlawfully sustaining a defective enforcement action to continue drawing federal funds.
✔ This is active financial fraud against both Plaintiff-Appellant and the federal government.

McHenry County and HFS are now subject to federal scrutiny for Title IV-D fraud. Multiple federal agencies are already reviewing these violations.

Every day they continue these unlawful enforcement actions, the State of Illinois is digging itself into deeper federal liability.

4. DISCOVERY DEADLINE: STATE ABOUT TO VIOLATE COURT-ORDERED DISCOVERY

Defendants have until March 24, 2025, to comply with discovery requests.

Failure to comply will confirm their willful defiance of federal court authority.

If they miss this deadline, additional sanctions and emergency judicial intervention will be pursued.

The Defendants are already in federal default. If they fail to comply with discovery, it will serve as further evidence of obstruction, fraud, and due process violations.

5. SEVENTH CIRCUIT: FEDERAL INTERVENTION PENDING

Multiple emergency motions are pending before the Seventh Circuit, including:

✔ Motion to Strike the Amended IWO as unlawful.
✔ Motion to Enjoin State Court Proceedings.
✔ Motion to Compel Judicial Notice of Retaliatory Prosecution.
✔ Motion to Declare Federal Supremacy Over Title IV-D Enforcement.

The Seventh Circuit is actively reviewing these motions, and a ruling is expected soon.

The question now is not IF federal intervention will happen—but WHEN.

6. NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC: THIS IS A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CASE WITH NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS

This case is bigger than just Plaintiff-Appellant.

Illinois is engaged in a systemic abuse of power against federal litigants, using financial coercion, retaliatory prosecution, and fraudulent enforcement to sustain unlawful child support collections.

If the State of Illinois is allowed to get away with this, NO federal litigant will be safe from state retaliation.

This case will set a critical precedent:

•	Can a federal litigant be unlawfully prosecuted by a state while an active appeal is pending?

•	Can states ignore federal preemption and continue enforcement actions post-default?

•	Will the federal courts uphold the constitutional rights of litigants, or allow rogue state officials to run unchecked?

This case is a major legal battle for federal supremacy, constitutional rights, and due process protections.

7. FINAL NOTICE: FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT IS COMING

Defendants have ignored federal law, defied court orders, and continued illegal enforcement actions.

They have left the Seventh Circuit no choice but to issue a strong ruling to enforce federal supremacy.

Time is up.

McHenry County, HFS, and all involved officials must cease their illegal conduct immediately.

Federal intervention is imminent.
