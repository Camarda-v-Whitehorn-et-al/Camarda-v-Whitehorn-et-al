    <h1>URGENT CASE UPDATE: FOR PUBLIC RELEASE</h1>

    <h2>Camarda v. Whitehorn, et al. â€“ Case No. 24-3244 (7th Circuit Court of Appeals)</h2>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 19, 2025</p>

    <p>Plaintiff-Appellant <strong>Thomas E. Camarda</strong> provides the following critical procedural update on the ongoing federal appeal before the Seventh Circuit and the ongoing retaliatory actions by Illinois state agencies.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">This case has escalated into a major constitutional crisis, with federal supremacy, due process, and civil rights violations at the forefront.</span></p>

    <p><strong>The Defendants are in total and unrecoverable default in the federal appeal</strong>, yet Illinois state officials continue unlawful actions, directly defying federal law.</p>

    <p class="bold">This is a legal and constitutional emergency that now demands maximum judicial enforcement.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. FEDERAL DEFAULT: DEFENDANTS HAVE FORFEITED ALL DEFENSES</h2>
        <p>Defendants failed to respond under <strong>FRAP 31(c)</strong>, placing them in <span class="bold">TOTAL procedural default.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Under <strong>FRAP 31(c)</strong>, when a party fails to respond in a federal appeal, they <strong>forfeit all arguments and admit liability by default.</strong></li>
            <li>This means that <strong>Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS)</strong> and all named officials <strong>have no legal standing left in this case.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Defendants have ignored federal authority for <span class="bold">over SIX MONTHS.</span></p>
        <p>They have attempted to pretend this lawsuit does not exist.</p>
        <p class="bold">Now, they face the consequences: full-scale federal legal accountability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW & JUDICIAL CONTEMPT</h2>
        <p>The State of Illinois is in <strong>active and knowing violation of federal law.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>âœ” Violates the <strong>Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2)</strong>.</li>
            <li>âœ” Violates controlling Supreme Court precedent (<strong>Blackledge v. Perry, Ex Parte Young, McCulloch v. Maryland</strong>, and more).</li>
            <li>âœ” Unlawful state enforcement while a federal case is pending constitutes <strong>due process violations, obstruction of justice, and financial fraud.</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. TITLE IV-D FRAUD AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL CRIMES</h2>
        <p>Illinois is engaged in systemic <span class="bold">Title IV-D fraud</span>, using unlawful collection actions to sustain an illegal revenue stream under <strong>42 U.S.C. Â§ 658a</strong>.</p>
        <p class="bold">The Defendants' conduct amounts to STATE-SPONSORED FINANCIAL FRAUD.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. DISCOVERY DEADLINE: STATE ABOUT TO VIOLATE COURT-ORDERED DISCOVERY</h2>
        <p><strong>Defendants have until March 24, 2025, to comply with discovery requests.</strong></p>
        <p>If they miss this deadline, additional <strong>sanctions and emergency judicial intervention</strong> will be pursued.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. SEVENTH CIRCUIT: FEDERAL INTERVENTION PENDING</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC: THIS IS A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CASE WITH NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS</h2>
        <p>This case is <strong>bigger than just Plaintiff-Appellant.</strong></p>
        <p>Illinois is engaged in a systemic abuse of power against federal litigants, using <strong>financial coercion, retaliatory prosecution, and fraudulent enforcement</strong> to sustain unlawful child support collections.</p>
        <p class="bold">If the State of Illinois is allowed to get away with this, NO federal litigant will be safe from state retaliation.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. FINAL NOTICE: FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT IS COMING</h2>
        <p><strong>Defendants have ignored federal law, defied court orders, and continued illegal enforcement actions.</strong></p>

    <h1>CASE SUMMARY: Camarda v. Whitehorn, et al.</h1>
    <h2>Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals â€“ Case No. 24-3244</h2>
    <h3>March 19, 2025 â€“ Public Release</h3>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>INTRODUCTION: A LANDMARK FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CASE</h2>
        <p>The case of <strong>Camarda v. Whitehorn, et al.</strong> has become one of the most significant legal battles over <strong>federal supremacy, civil rights violations, and unconstitutional state enforcement.</strong></p>
        <p>At its core, this case is about whether state officials can continue illegal enforcement actions after being sued in federal courtâ€”and whether they can retaliate against a federal litigant with financial coercion and criminal prosecution to escape accountability.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</strong> now holds the key to reaffirming federal supremacy and stopping systemic misconduct by Illinois state agencies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>THE CORE ISSUES AT STAKE</h2>
        <p>This lawsuit centers around <strong>unlawful child support enforcement, financial fraud, and retaliatory prosecution</strong> carried out by the <strong>Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS)</strong> and its officials.</p>
        <p>Despite being in total procedural default, the Defendants have ignored federal authority and continued illegal enforcement actions.</p>
        <p><strong>The legal violations exposed in this case include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Unlawful Wage Garnishment & Asset Seizure</span> â€“ Financial coercion used against a federal litigant while the case is pending.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Retaliatory Criminal Charges</span> â€“ McHenry County prosecutors pursuing an illegal charge in direct violation of Supreme Court precedent.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Fraudulent Child Support Modifications</span> â€“ Defendants illegally altered an income withholding order after defaulting in the federal appeal.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Federal Due Process Violations</span> â€“ Ignoring federal court jurisdiction while continuing illegal enforcement actions.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Title IV-D Fraud</span> â€“ Illinois continuing illegitimate collections to obtain federal incentive funds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This is not just a dispute over child supportâ€”this is about abuse of power and illegal financial control by the state over individuals.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>DEFENDANTS ARE IN TOTAL FEDERAL DEFAULT</h2>
        <p>The Defendants in this case have been <strong>procedurally and legally defeated.</strong></p>
        <p>They failed to respond to the appeal by the required deadline, putting them in <strong>total default under FRAP 31(c).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>This means:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">ðŸš¨ They have forfeited all legal defenses.</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">ðŸš¨ They have no standing left in this case.</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">ðŸš¨ They have admitted liability by default.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Yet, despite being in procedural free fall, the Defendants have continued illegal enforcement actions, <strong>desperately trying to pretend this lawsuit doesnâ€™t exist.</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>Seventh Circuit is now poised to enforce federal law against them.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>TITLE IV-D FRAUD: FINANCIAL CRIMES UNDER FEDERAL SCRUTINY</h2>
        <p>At the heart of this case is <strong>fraudulent child support enforcement</strong> under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ðŸ”´ Illinois receives federal funding for every dollar collected in child support enforcement.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ðŸ”´ They are sustaining an unlawful enforcement action to keep receiving these funds.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ðŸ”´ This is financial fraud against both the federal government and the Plaintiff-Appellant.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This case is now under federal scrutiny for potential violations of federal financial regulations, including misuse of federal incentive funding.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>MASSIVE FEDERAL INTERVENTION IMMINENT</h2>
        <p>The Seventh Circuit is now reviewing multiple emergency motions, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>âœ” Motion to Strike the Amended IWO as unlawful.</li>
            <li>âœ” Motion to Enjoin State Court Proceedings.</li>
            <li>âœ” Motion to Compel Judicial Notice of Retaliatory Prosecution.</li>
            <li>âœ” Motion to Declare Federal Supremacy Over Title IV-D Enforcement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The ruling will determine the limits of state power and whether rogue officials can evade federal litigation through fraud and retaliation.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section final-notice">
        <h2>CASE STATUS: RULING EXPECTED SOON</h2>
        <p>This case is now at a critical juncture.</p>
        <p>All arguments are filed.</p>
        <p>All procedural deadlines are passed.</p>
        <p>All state actions are illegal and in violation of federal law.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Seventh Circuitâ€™s ruling</strong> is expected soon.</p>
        <p><strong>This case is now a federal showdown between state corruption and constitutional enforcement.</strong></p>
