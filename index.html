    <h1>URGENT CASE UPDATE: FOR PUBLIC RELEASE</h1>

    <h2>Camarda v. Whitehorn, et al. – Case No. 24-3244 (7th Circuit Court of Appeals)</h2>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 19, 2025</p>

    <p>Plaintiff-Appellant <strong>Thomas E. Camarda</strong> provides the following critical procedural update on the ongoing federal appeal before the Seventh Circuit and the ongoing retaliatory actions by Illinois state agencies.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">This case has escalated into a major constitutional crisis, with federal supremacy, due process, and civil rights violations at the forefront.</span></p>

    <p><strong>The Defendants are in total and unrecoverable default in the federal appeal</strong>, yet Illinois state officials continue unlawful actions, directly defying federal law.</p>

    <p class="bold">This is a legal and constitutional emergency that now demands maximum judicial enforcement.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. FEDERAL DEFAULT: DEFENDANTS HAVE FORFEITED ALL DEFENSES</h2>
        <p>Defendants failed to respond under <strong>FRAP 31(c)</strong>, placing them in <span class="bold">TOTAL procedural default.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Under <strong>FRAP 31(c)</strong>, when a party fails to respond in a federal appeal, they <strong>forfeit all arguments and admit liability by default.</strong></li>
            <li>This means that <strong>Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS)</strong> and all named officials <strong>have no legal standing left in this case.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Defendants have ignored federal authority for <span class="bold">over SIX MONTHS.</span></p>
        <p>They have attempted to pretend this lawsuit does not exist.</p>
        <p class="bold">Now, they face the consequences: full-scale federal legal accountability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW & JUDICIAL CONTEMPT</h2>
        <p>The State of Illinois is in <strong>active and knowing violation of federal law.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Violates the <strong>Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2)</strong>.</li>
            <li>✔ Violates controlling Supreme Court precedent (<strong>Blackledge v. Perry, Ex Parte Young, McCulloch v. Maryland</strong>, and more).</li>
            <li>✔ Unlawful state enforcement while a federal case is pending constitutes <strong>due process violations, obstruction of justice, and financial fraud.</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. TITLE IV-D FRAUD AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL CRIMES</h2>
        <p>Illinois is engaged in systemic <span class="bold">Title IV-D fraud</span>, using unlawful collection actions to sustain an illegal revenue stream under <strong>42 U.S.C. § 658a</strong>.</p>
        <p class="bold">The Defendants' conduct amounts to STATE-SPONSORED FINANCIAL FRAUD.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. DISCOVERY DEADLINE: STATE ABOUT TO VIOLATE COURT-ORDERED DISCOVERY</h2>
        <p><strong>Defendants have until March 24, 2025, to comply with discovery requests.</strong></p>
        <p>If they miss this deadline, additional <strong>sanctions and emergency judicial intervention</strong> will be pursued.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. SEVENTH CIRCUIT: FEDERAL INTERVENTION PENDING</h2>
        <p>Multiple emergency motions are pending before the <strong>Seventh Circuit</strong>, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Motion to <strong>Strike the Amended IWO</strong> as unlawful.</li>
            <li>✔ Motion to <strong>Enjoin State Court Proceedings</strong>.</li>
            <li>✔ Motion to <strong>Compel Judicial Notice of Retaliatory Prosecution</strong>.</li>
            <li>✔ Motion to <strong>Declare Federal Supremacy Over Title IV-D Enforcement</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bold">The Seventh Circuit is actively reviewing these motions, and a ruling is expected soon.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC: THIS IS A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CASE WITH NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS</h2>
        <p>This case is <strong>bigger than just Plaintiff-Appellant.</strong></p>
        <p>Illinois is engaged in a systemic abuse of power against federal litigants, using <strong>financial coercion, retaliatory prosecution, and fraudulent enforcement</strong> to sustain unlawful child support collections.</p>
        <p class="bold">If the State of Illinois is allowed to get away with this, NO federal litigant will be safe from state retaliation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. FINAL NOTICE: FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT IS COMING</h2>
        <p><strong>Defendants have ignored federal law, defied court orders, and continued illegal enforcement actions.</strong></p>
        <p>They have left the <strong>Seventh Circuit</strong> no choice but to issue a strong ruling to enforce federal supremacy.</p>
        <p class="bold">Time is up.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Issued:</strong> March 19, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Plaintiff-Appellant:</strong> Thomas E. Camarda</p>
    <p><strong>Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals – Case No. 24-3244</strong></p>
